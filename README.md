# Incling - Django REST Framework Sample


## Installation and Usage

- Clone or download the repo
- Within your virtual environment, run: ``` pip install -r requirements.txt``` 
- Make your migrations
- Run your Django server with ```python manage.py runserver```

 

## Assumptions & Comments

- My understanding was that the Tiles must have at least one task in them at all times and so I have added in a little bit of error handing for when a PUT or PATCH request attempts to change a taskâ€™s tile. If the Tile only has that one task in it,  a 422 error will be raised. This can be bypassed by using the CRUD features on the Django admin to manually update them. Given more time, I would like to have explored an alternative approach to handling these checks - Possibly refactoring the checks into the serializer or model pre-save functions
- I made assumptions about what the Order field was so I just used a randomly generated order reference number at pre-save - Please let me know if you wish any changes to this
- Tile launch date set to current time on creation - please let me know if this should be different



## Available API requests

### ------------ Tasks ---------------

LIST
- GET: api/tasks/
- No body Required

CREATE
- POST: api/tasks/
- Body Required - All fields as shown
- Example body:
- ``` 
  {
      "title" : "Task 1",
      "description" : "Clean up desktop",
      "task_type" : 1
  }
  ```
- Tasks will initially be assigned null for their task foreign key and can be assigned with PUT or PATCH Requests. They will also be automatically assigned when a tile is created (see tile creation below)
- Tasks will randomly generate an order reference on creation and save to this field. As mentioned, if this needs to be different, please let me know.

RETRIEVE
- GET: api/tasks/```<task_id:int>```/
- No body Required

UPDATE
- PUT: api/tasks/```<task_id:int>```/

- If no tile field is included, the task will remain with it's existing assigned tile (or null)
- Tile changing - The task can only be re-assigned to a new tile if the existing tile will have at least one task remaining in it.

	{
        "task_type" : 2 ,
        "title" : "Newly updated Task!",
        "description" : "Did you clean the desktop yet?",
        "tile" : 10
    }
  ```

### ------------ Tiles---------------

LIST
- GET: api/tiles/

CREATE
- POST: api/tiles/

       "tasks": [1,5]
    }
  ```
